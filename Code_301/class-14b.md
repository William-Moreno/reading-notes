# Project Ideas

Create an app that users can enter a word/subject into and so a search that returns images, sound files, quotes, books, movies, songs and maybe top website that are all related to the search and store the results together as a single entity in a database for future retrieval. If the resources are pulled from sites like unsplash, these could be resources that the user could use to create further apps.
